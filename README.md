# dan's experimental language (del)
This is probably the last time I will try to make a programming language

`del` is a minimal programming language designed to be embedded in C applications. It is statically typed and has functions, classes, and the usual control flow mechanisms. It's main design goals are to be fast, simple, and intuitive. I intend to use it as a scripting language for writing an interactive fiction game, but we'll see if that ever happens.

The language is **not done**. It will hopefully be done in a few months.

## TODO
- Clean up parser
- Fix string implementation
- Finish implementing classes 
- Implement arrays
- Implement interfaces
- Implement garbage collection
- Improve performance (maybe require redesigning the VM)
